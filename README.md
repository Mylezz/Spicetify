I got tired of having to install older versions of spotify so I hacked together a workaround for the old version of rainmeeter spicetfy to work. Once you have installed spicetify-cli put the custom theme named "dank" that is included in this download under themes in %userprofile%\.spicetify\Themes\ and run in powershell "spicetify config current_theme dank" and then "spicetify apply" once that is done you can now use Rainmeeter Spicetify to modify the colors if it isnt already the correct colors for the theme sometimes it works sometimes it wont.
